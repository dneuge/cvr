# 3rd-party dependencies

3rd-party dependencies can be licensed in a way that restricts the combined (i.e. compiled) work from distribution under MIT license. As the MIT license allows sublicensing, it is believed that the work as a whole can implicitely "downgrade" to other licenses if needed. Anyone who plans on distributing binaries should evaluate license compatibility and the need for such "downgrades" or additional terms individually. In general, declaration of the main source code as MIT licensed does not allow any direct conclusions on the license of a compiled build.
